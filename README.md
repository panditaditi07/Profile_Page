So this is the basic website using HTML and CSS.
Over here I have use the Semantic Elements
1.What is Semantic element?
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
The basic Semantic elements used here are:
A. <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.
B. <nav> element defines a set of navigation links.
C. <section> element defines section in a document.
D. <footer> element defines a footer for a document or section.

2.The non-semantic element I have used over here is <div>
<div> is used to make section or a division in an HTML document. It is also use as a container.
